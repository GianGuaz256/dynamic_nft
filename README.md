NFTs are a very interesting tool that will undoubtedly revolutionize the world of digital ownership. For now, the concept of NFT is closely related to the metadata that defines its properties, characteristics and interface. 

But what if NFT could become dynamic? 

What if NFT could represent the history and the historical data of an asset?

This is an experiment to improve the world of NFT, to make it take a step forward towards a mainstream future where digital ownership will allow the exchange of stories, ideas and moments. 

Cheers!
